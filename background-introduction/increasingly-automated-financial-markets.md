# increasingly automated financial markets

Since Satoshi Nakamoto released the BTC white paper in 2009, the blockchain has evolved into a gradually mature financial market after more than ten years of development. With the popularization of mobile Internet and smart terminals, as well as the development of robotics and big data technologies , the application prospect of robots in the blockchain field is very good, and the future digital currency field will develop in a more intelligent direction, which is the general trend of the industry.

According to the "Financial Times" report, Citigroup President Jamie Forres said that 40% of Citibank's operating positions can be completely replaced by machines. In the future, fewer people will make more money, and robots will take over most financial services.

94% said that robots and automated smart programs will be introduced in the    next three years. Among them, 62% said that 1/4 of transactions have been automated, and 8% said that half of their company's transactions are completed by robots.
