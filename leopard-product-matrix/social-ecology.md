In the future, Leopard will be based on the DAO community and extend to the real business field. Leopard DAO will be a blockchain interest community with blockchain as the underlying technology, a life service platform dedicated to serving blockchain enthusiasts and social interests.



Leopard builds a global autonomous community based on DAO governance contracts. The members are composed of ecological users from all over the world. Through the governance of Leopard DAO, all consensuses are reflected, and the Leopard metaverse is collectively governed.



The Leopard DAO is decentralized because it has no formal leadership; it is autonomous by allowing any member to make decisions. DAOs are mission driven and the main goal is to create ecological value. Once a member of the Leopard DAO, everyone is involved in the development of the ecosystem. Each member's contribution will be incentivized in terms of income, and they will voluntarily contribute their efforts to ecological development.
