# Dual Center Metaverse Ecology

In the future, the development of Leopard will, on the one hand, turn from reality to reality, to realize the digital metaverse ecology of real experience, and on the other hand, from reality to reality, realize the reality of digital experience.



The coexistence of virtual and reality is the key feature of Leopard's metaverse ecology. The development of Leopard will form a dual-centric ecosystem of an industry metaverse centered on promoting real-world economic efficiency and a consumer metaverse centered on enriching the personal spiritual world.



Diversified fusion is the future evolution trend of the Metaverse. In the initial stage of Leopard's development, a decentralized and multi-center metaverse ecosystem will be formed with various industries as the core, and then the data and standards will be gradually opened up between similar ecosystems to achieve similar integration.
